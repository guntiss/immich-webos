// A hung fetch (TCP stall, silently-dropped connection — common over flaky TV
// wifi to a self-hosted NAS) would otherwise never settle. media.ts gates
// thumbnail loads through a fixed pool of in-flight slots; a fetch that never
// resolves nor rejects permanently burns its slot, and once all slots are dead
// the whole grid stops loading (the network goes idle mid-scroll). So every
// request is bounded by an AbortController timeout: on timeout the fetch aborts,
// the promise rejects, and the slot is freed for the next asset.
// AbortController is Chrome 66, and webOS 4.x TVs (the 2019 C9 reports
// Chrome/53) don't have it — `new AbortController()` threw there, so every
// thumbnail and video load failed and the grid rendered blank. The timeout is
// what actually matters for the pool, so race the request against a timer and
// only cancel for real where the API exists. Without it the socket is left to
// finish on its own, but the promise still settles and the slot is freed.
